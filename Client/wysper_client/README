Thank you for choosing to use Wysper software!

To install this application, run the 'install.sh' script in a terminal.
It will ask for your password which is necessary for it to create the
necessary directories to install the client application.

After the installation is complete, feel free to move the
'WysperClient.desktop' application to anywhere on your computer where
it is easily accessible (we recommend your desktop). This application
is double clickable and will run the Wysper software whenever you
click it.

Happy messaging!
