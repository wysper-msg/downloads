Thank you for choosing to use Wysper software!

To install this application, run the 'install.sh' script in a terminal.
It will ask for your password which is necessary for it to create the
necessary directories to install the client application.


As a reminder, your default Java installation must be the Oracle
issued Java 8 JRE. If an OpenJDK JRE or a later Java version is your
default, then the execution of this application is not guaranteed.
If you have a binary installed for the Java 8 JRE, you can modify the
client.desktop file to call this binary instead of the 'java' keyword.


After the installation is complete, feel free to move the
'client.desktop' application to anywhere on your computer where
it is easily accessible (we recommend your desktop). This application
is double clickable and will run the Wysper software whenever you
click it.

Happy messaging!
